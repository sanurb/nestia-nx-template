## Type System Integrity

- Utilize TypeScript's features to ensure type safety.
- Prefer interfaces over types when defining object shapes or when modelling inheritance ([interface-extends.md](mdc:./interface-extends.md))..
- Use generics to create reusable functions.
- Avoid `any`; use [`unknown`, `never`, or generics`] where possible ([any-inside-generic-functions.md](mdc:./any-inside-generic-functions.md)).
- Avoid optional (`?`) props unless truly optional. Prefer explicit `T | undefined` ([optional-properties.md](mdc:./optional-properties.md)).
- Mark data structures as [`readonly`] by default ([readonly-properties.md](mdc:./readonly-properties.md)).
- Use `import type` for all type-only imports to avoid unnecessary runtime module inclusion ([import-type.md](mdc:./import-type.md)).

## Declarative Safety

- **All control paths must be explicit**. No fallthroughs, no dynamic behavior leakage.
- Prefer discriminated unions for finite state modeling ([discriminated-unions.md](mdc:./discriminated-unions.md)).
- Avoid default parameters with logic—keep function signatures deterministic.
- Model state with total functions. Every path in your function must return a value of the declared type or throw.
- Validate all inputs at module boundaries.

## Structural Simplicity

- Prefer composition over inheritance — always. Inheritance introduces tight coupling and implicit behavior; composition encourages reusability and testability.
- Always reach for **function composition, closures, or object literals** before extending a base class.
- Use data + behavior → not class hierarchies unless modeling a strict algebraic hierarchy.
- Avoid `enum`. Use `as const` literal objects and derive keys/types via `keyof typeof` ([enums.md](mdc:./enums.md)):
- Flatten logic. Do not deeply nest functions. Control flow belongs in the parent; logic belongs in leaves.
- Minimize mutation and side effects. Favor pure computation over stateful logic.

## Documentation and Comments

- Use JSDoc only when the function’s purpose or constraints are not obvious ([jsdoc-comments.md](jsdoc-comments.md)).
- Never write comments for what the code is doing.
- Comment why, not what. Document domain knowledge, design decisions, invariants, code is non-obvious by design, and non-obvious consequences.
- Comments must age gracefully. Prefer deleting them if no longer essential.
- Use @link to reference internal constructs meaningfully.
